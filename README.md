# Sentiment Analysis Project - NLP

**Description:**  
This project is a **sentiment analysis tool** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It analyzes text data (e.g., reviews, tweets, or comments) and predicts the sentiment as **positive, negative, or neutral**. This project is intended for users with **intermediate Python experience** and some familiarity with NLP concepts.



## Project Overview
- Perform sentiment classification on text data  
- Implement preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal  
- Apply feature extraction methods: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or embeddings  
- Train machine learning and deep learning models for classification  
- Evaluate models using accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains text samples labeled with sentiment categories.  
- Example sources: tweets, product reviews, or social media comments  
- Contains fields like `text` and `sentiment` (positive, negative, neutral)  

---

## Features
- Text preprocessing for NLP pipelines  
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF or embeddings  
- Classification using traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM) or deep learning (LSTM, BERT)  
- Performance evaluation with multiple metrics  
- Visualizations of sentiment distribution and model performance  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, or PyTorch  
- NLTK / SpaCy for text preprocessing  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook
